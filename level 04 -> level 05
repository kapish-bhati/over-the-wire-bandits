login to the level 4 lab
by runnign the follwing in your shell
> ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and enter the password as found earlier

here you could either open all files one by one but that is ot very efficient

thus we use a wildcard

execute the following commands

$ ls
$ cd inhere
$ ls -l
$ file ./*
this gives the following output
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data

from the 10 files only file 7 is in human readable ASCII text
thus that holds the password
$cat <-file07

the password
