here we have to read a dashed file 

execute the following commands
$ls
-
$ cat <-
263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

this is the password

theory:
to read a dashed file you have multiple ways
1. redirection (as i did)
    cat < -file_name

2. specifying the path
    cat /home/bandit1/-

3. more command
    more - 

4. rev utility
    rev - | rev
all work and have the same effect
