# over-the-wire-bandits
this is a level by level walkthrough for over the wire's bandit CTF for people who are stuck.


Bnadit is a CTF from Over The Wire for people who are getting into Linux and for those who want to hone their linux skills

This CTF has a steep learning curve but it is fun trying to solve these problems

I have provided the answer key at the end of each level file, but i urge you to try and crack it yourself. 

This CTF requires a lot of reading but once you're through with it you will have a much better grasp over the fundamentals of Linux than you did before
